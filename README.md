# React Portfolio

## Description

This app serves as a portfolio for some of my completed projects created with React.

The layout contains an About Me (landing page), Portfolio with links to the deployed applications and corresponding repos, a Contact page, and a Resume/Skills page.

## Usage

Navigation links are within the header that can be used to move between the different pages.

Links to all project pages and repos are displayed when clicking on Portfolio. The Contact page will display an error message if no name, valid email, or message are entered when clicking into and out of the fields. The Resume page includes a link to a resume (to be updated) and technologies/skills I have experience with.

## Contributors
